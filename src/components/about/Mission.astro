        <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
          Very Good Marketing Co. LLC was founded in 2024 with a clear mission: to help small
          businesses market themselves effectively without being swindled.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
          After seeing too many small businesses waste their limited resources on ineffective
          marketing tactics or overpriced services, our founders decided to create a company that
          prioritizes transparency, education, and results.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
          We believe that every business, regardless of size, deserves access to effective marketing
          strategies and honest advice about what will truly help them grow.
